# Bear & Quotes Generator
Welcome to the Bear Quotes Generator, a website that uses two APIs to generate pictures of bears and inspirational quotes!

# Getting Started
To use the Bear Quotes Generator, simply navigate to the homepage and select which type of content you would like to generate. You can choose to generate pictures of bears, inspirational quotes, or a combination of the two.

- Inspirational Quote API: This API generates inspirational quotes based on user input. Users can filter the types of quotes they want to see (e.g., quotes about courage, quotes about perseverance, etc.).
